# DigitallockbaseCode
this Project is Build Simple Digital Lock system control by Atmega 128\
Some easy to find Component in this project:
 - 12V solenoid Lock
 - 20x4 HD44780 Liquid Crystal LCD
 - 4x4 numpad
> Code written in Microchip Studio\
> Program uploaded to ATmega128 using AVR USBasp Programmer

You can go watch my test circuit at (https://github.com/leafhuy/DigitallockbaseCode/blob/main/DigitalLockCircuitProteus.png)
>Note: In the Proteus simulation, the 12V solenoid lock is replaced by a light bulb to represent the locking mechanism.
